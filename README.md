# Mapbox-gl-js React Components
## Goals
Mapbox-gl-js is a powerful piece of software. For use inside of a React application, the map should have only a thin component layer to preserve the power and flexibility of Mapbox-gl.

The goal of this component collection is to provide a lightweight shim for using Mapbox-gl with React without abstracting too much and maintaining the paradigm already used in the library.

## Install

With NPM:
`npm install --save-dev mapbox-gl-react`

## Example

This repository comes with an example usage. You can run it with `npm install` and
`npm start`.
