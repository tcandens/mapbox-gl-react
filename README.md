# Mapbox-gl-js React Components
## Goals
Mapbox-gl is a wonderfully and thoughtful piece of software. For use inside of a React application, the map should have only a thin component layer to preserve the power and flexibility of Mapbox-gl.

The goal of these components is to provide a lightweight shim for using Mapbox-gl with React without abstracting too much and maintaining the paradigm already used in the library.
